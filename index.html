            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

            <p>I am Victory Deo Full Stack Congolese developer with 4 years of experience. My passion for web development began in 2018 and from then on, I did everything I could to break into this path, while having fun on the various projects developed. My experience acquired over the course of the projects allows me to better understand the expectations of a client and to respond precisely to the need requested according to the field of activity.
